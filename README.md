# OpenGL Car Animation with Rain, Trees, Clouds, and Plants

This project is a dynamic 2D OpenGL animation simulating a car driving along a road. The scene features a vibrant environment including trees, clouds, roadside plants, and a toggling rain effect. The car continuously moves left-to-right or right-to-left, and the rain effect switches on and off periodically to create a more immersive animated scene.

## Features

1. Smooth car movement with rotating wheels.
2. Daylight sky with drifting clouds.
3. Multi-layered tree foliage for depth.
4. Randomly toggled rain animation with falling raindrops.
5. Small roadside plants for added detail.
6. Direction control and speed adjustment via keyboard.
7. Lightweight and runs using only core OpenGL and GLUT.

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `+` or `=` | Increase car speed |
| `-`         | Decrease car speed |
| `M` or `m`  | Move car to the right (forward) |
| `R` or `r`  | Move car to the left (reverse) |
| `ESC`       | Exit the application |

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, MinGW, or clang++)
- OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) installed
- OpenGL development libraries
